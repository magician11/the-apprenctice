# React App Starting Point

Simple and solid starting point for React.js apps.

Uses: eslint, webpack, sass, es6

## To start

Install the packages by typing `npm install`

To run the local server, then type `npm run dev`

and then to view your app running, goto [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

Then goto GitHub and [create a new repository](https://github.com/new).

Now remove the remote that is pointing to the starting point, by typing
`git remote rm origin`

Now you can add this starting point to your new repo you just created by typing
`git remote add origin [https://github.com/your-username/your-new-repo.git]`

Edit this README and any other files at this point, then type `git commit -a -m "my first update"`.
